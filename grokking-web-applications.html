A long time ago, 1966 to be precise, [two computers had a phone
call](http://www.packet.cc/files/toward-coop-net.html). In 1967, a member of
DARPA proposed we use [multiple computer networks for intercomputer
communication](http://www.packet.cc/files/multi-net-inter-comm.html). The vision
was bold. Computers all over the world could share data and computing resources!
Thus began ARPANET. ARPANET connected a few computers at a well-funded
miliatary and civilian research instittions.

The initial design of the ARPANET, while revolutionary, was missing a key
component. It didn't allow data to be shared across multiple networks! This
meant that if you wanted to access data from the Stanford computers, you would
need to connect to their network directly. If you wanted data from MIT, you woul
have to connect to MIT. Imagine having to re-connect to the Internet every time
you went to a different web site!

In 1974, [a new protocol](http://www.cs.ucla.edu/classes/cs217/cerf74.pdf) was
designed to solve the many isolated networks problem by introducing the concept
of a gateway. Gateways connect networks to one another by providing a way to
route data between the networks. By connecting your network to a gateway
network, data could be sent from your network to MITs network to Stanfords
network quickly and reliably!

The number of connected machines grew tremendously. Notes from an experiment in
Boston could be read by an associate in Berkeley. Researches could publish
preliminary data and get feedback within days, instead of months. It was
incredible!
