title: A Gentle Introduction to Computer Programming
---

A common myth is that computer programming is magic. Programmers are wizards or
sorceresses sitting in a dark room, cackling and muttering incantations, and
weaving spells that power everyday things like automobiles, facebook, medical
devices, and airplanes.

This is not true. Computer programming is like patiently guiding a very
stubborn, very pedantic small child with limited vocabulary and life experience
through a problem that you barely understand yourself.

It just so happenes that the child is shaped something like a computer.
