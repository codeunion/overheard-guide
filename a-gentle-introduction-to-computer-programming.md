A common myth is computer programming is magic. Programmers are wizards or
sorceresses floating in a darkened room, cackling while muttering incantations,
and weaving spells that power everyday things like automobiles, facebook,
medical devices, and airplanes.

This is not true. Computer programming is like patiently guiding a very
stubborn, very pedantic small child with limited vocabulary and life experience
through a problem you barely understand yourself.

The result of guiding a computer to solve a problem is known as a program.  All
programs have three parts:

* Outcomes - How a programs user is different because they use the program.
* Interactions - How users work with the program.
* Implementations - The internal structure of the program.

**Good programmers implement programs that encourage the interactions that
generate the users desired outcomes.**

### How Can I Be a Good Programmer?

**Good programmers have empathy**. They shift their mental state into the
machine that runs the program or into the people who use the program. They use
this empathy to figure out what they want the program to do as well as how to do
it. They then communicate this to the machine with code.

Empathizing with the computer is a difficult task.  Novice programmers must
learn to build a solid understanding of how, what, and why the machine works
without falling into a rabbit hole of incomprehensible detail.

### What Should I Focus On?

The primary way to distinguish what kind of programmers you are is whether you
understand people or machines:

* Systems Programmers - Primarily empathize with machines. They build systems
  that respond quickly to user input and stay up even when there are many users.
  These are the people who ensure Google can search billions of web pages in
  milliseconds. Sometimes called "Back end" programmers.

* User Interface Programmers - Empathise mostly with users. They build
  interfaces to assist users in accomplishing their goals. These people work
  closely with designers and introduce ideas like [Google instant
  search](http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/instant/about.html).

* Balanced Programmers - Empathize with both users and machines. They are 
  versatile, yet rare. It may take longer for skills to develop because of a
  lack of focus.

If you are motivated by making things for people to see and use you may want to focus on
being a user interface programmer.

If you are moticated primarily by knowledge and deep understanding of computers,
and prefer admiration from your peers over the admiration of the public, consider systems programming.

If you are unsure, consider balancing your focus between systems and user
interfaces. You may discover you enjoy one over the other and will naturally
gravitate in that direction.

### What Kinds of Programs Are There?

If we use the outcomes/interactions/implementations framework, we may start to
categorize programs based upon what they focus on:

* Application - An equal mix of outcome, interaction, and implementation focus.
  Examples: [eBay](http://www.ebay.com), [Uber](https://www.uber.com), [Google
  Search](https://www.google.com), [Simple](https://www.simple.com), etc.
* Toys - Primarily focused on interaction. Examples:
  [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/), [Threes](http://asherv.com/threes/), etc.
* Tools - Primarily focused on implementation. Examples: [Flight Control
  Systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_management_system), [Engine
  Control Units](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_control_unit), Etc.

This guide focuses primarily on applications that are delivered over the web.
