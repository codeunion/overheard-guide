Any good story starts with the main character; and in this story
that happens to be you. So let's spend a moment getting to know
you.

You're not put of by a bit of hard work. You can type at least 40
wpm. You know how to pace yourself and take breaks. You're not
afraid to ask questions when you don't understand something or get
stuck. You don't mind thinking hard and reasoning through things.

You'll make a fantastic computer programmer.

A common myth is that computer programming is magic. Programmers are wizards or
sorceresses sitting in a darkened room; cackling and muttering incantations as
they weave spells that power everyday things like automobiles, facebook,
medical devices, and airplanes.

This is not remotely true. Computer programming is much more akin to sitting
patiently and guiding a very stubborn, very pedantic small child with a limited
vocabulary and life experience through a problem. It just so happenes that the
child is shaped something like a computer.

My hope is by the point you're reading this you're already familiar with
writing and running ruby code on your computer. If not, I cannot recommend
Chris Pine's [Learn to Program](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/) enough. For
those of you seeking hands-on guidance; the
[##new2ruby](http://webchat.freenode.net) irc chat room is a very welcoming place.

For those seeking a more structured approach to learning programming;
[Codeunion]'s Web Fundamentals course is, in my somewhat biased opinion, an
excellent start; with uncannily helpful, compassionate, and clear-thinking
instructors.
