tags:

This book is intended to provide a fun, approachable way to learn to:

* Build Ruby web applications with Sinatra and DataMapper
* Test drive ruby web applications with MiniTest and Capybara
* Design and build Web APIs in Ruby with Sinatra
* Build client libraries for Web APIs in Ruby

### Who This is For

Any good story starts with the main character; and that character is you.

You're not put off by a bit of hard work. You can type confidently. You know how
to pace yourself and take breaks. You ask questions when you don't understand
something. You don't mind thinking hard and reasoning through things.

In short, you'll be a fantastic computer programmer.

### Get Your Bearings

While you may work through this chapter-by-chapter; it is possible (and more
enjoyable!) to treat this book as a map. Each region can be explored deeply or
skipped entirely; it's completely up to you.

Every region will have a list of recommended places to visit afterwards; and any
potentially hairy areas will let you know that you may want to have visited
somewhere else first.

### Prerequisites

By the time you're reading this you should already be familiar with writing and
running ruby code on your computer. If not, I cannot recommend Chris Pine's
[Learn to Program](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/) enough. For those of you
seeking hands-on guidance; the [##new2ruby](http://webchat.freenode.net) irc
chat room is a very welcoming place.

For those seeking a guided, mentored approach to learning programming;
[Codeunion](http://codeunion.io)'s Web Fundamentals course is, in my biased
opinion, an excellent start. The instructors are uncannily helpful,
compassionate, and clear-thinking.
