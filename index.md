This guide is a fun, approachable way to learn to:

* Build ruby web applications with Sinatra and DataMapper
* Design and build Web APIs in Ruby with Sinatra
* Test ruby web applications with MiniTest and Capybara

### Is This Guide For Me?

_The Novice Rubyists Guide to Web Application Development_ is intended for people
who are already comfortable writing and running ruby code on their computer.

If that does not describe you, I cannot recommend Chris Pine's [Learn to
Program](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/) enough. For those seeking
hands-on guidance; the [##new2ruby](http://webchat.freenode.net) irc chat room
is a warm, welcoming, and helpful place.

It is also helpful to have some familiarity with HTML and CSS. Shaye Howe's
[Learn to Code HTML &amp; CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/) is the
perfect resource for those seeking a solid foundation.

For those seeking a professional instruction [Codeunion](http://codeunion.io)'s
Web Fundamentals course is excellent. The instructors are uncannily helpful,
compassionate, and clear-thinking.

### How Do I Know I Can Learn to Write Web Applications?

There's no disqualifier for who can or cannot learn to program. Over the past
decade of teaching hundreds of programmers, I've noticed some themes:

You're not put off by a bit of hard work. You can type confidently. You know
when to perservere, when to take breaks, and when to ask for help. You ask
questions when you get confused. You don't mind thinking over something slowly
and reasoning through it. Did I mention you ask questions and get help?

Does this describe you? If so, great! If not, these are learnable skills you'll
pick up in no time!

### Where Should I Start?

While you may work through this chapter-by-chapter; it is possible (and more
enjoyable!) to treat this guide as a map. Each region can be explored deeply or
skipped entirely; it's completely up to you.

Every page will have recommended places to visit afterwards; and any potentially
hairy areas will let you know that you may want to reference something else
before hand.

### Recommended Next Steps
* If you're looking for a solid foundation in programming, go to [a gentle

* If you're eager to jump right into web applications, I recommend [grokking web
